<p>The <strong>Data Science for Biomedical Scientists</strong> project is funded by <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk">The Alan Turing Institute</a> - <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg">AI for Science and Government</a> (ASG) Research Programme.
This training material provides an introduction to data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Providing contexts and examples from biomedical research, this material will discuss AI for automation, the process of unsupervised and supervised machine learning, their practical applications and common pitfalls that researchers should be aware of in order to maintain scientific rigour and research ethics.
</p>

<p>This project builds on <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/">The Turing Way</a>, <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> and <a href="https://openlifesci.org/">Open Life Science</a> practices. Hosted by the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/tools-practices-and-systems-open-leadership-team-call-volunteering">Tools, practices and systems</a> (TPS) research team, all materials are shared under CC-BY 4.0 License. Although the training course is tailored to the biomedical sciences community, materials will be generally transferable and directly relevant for data science projects across different domains. Anyone interested in collaboration and improvements of this material is welcome to connect with the development team on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/managing-computational-projects">see the repository</a>).</p>

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This resource is designed for experimental biologists and biomedical research communities, with a focus on two key professional/career groups:
> * Group leaders or lab managers without prior experience with Data Science or management of computational projects
> * Postdoc and lab scientists (next-generation senior leaders) interested in enabling the integration of computational science into biosciences
>
> In defining the scope of this project for our target audience, we make some assumptions about the learner groups:
>
> * Our learners have a good understanding of designing or contributing to a scientific project throughout its lifecycle.
> * They have a computational project in mind for which funding and research ethics approval have been received.
> * We also assume that the research team of any size is (either partially or fully) established.
